"""
Use this script to fetch the datapoints of the devices paired with your CCU.
Depending on the specified port different devices will be presented:
2000 -> BidCos-Wired
2001 -> BidCos-RF
2010 -> HmIP-RF

Availability of these ports may depend on the CCU version, and as of now,
Homegear has no HmIP support.

To use this script (on Linux with Python 3 installed) place it on the machines
filesystem, mark it executable (chmod 755 datapoints.py), and execute like this:
/path/to/file/datapoints.py http://ccu.ip.addr.ess:2001
This will print out all available details of your devices for you to analyze.
If you want to provide this data to someone else, append a filename (devices.json)
to the command above.
The raw JSON that's being saved isn't pretty to read, but can be imported and read
by capable applications.
Device-IDs, addresses etc. are being anonymized. So posting the results of this
script online shouldn't be an issue since no private data is leaked (unless I
forgot to overwrite something critical).

Note: this is a quick-and-dirty script with minor testing and no validation of
provided parameters. So as always, use at your own risk.
